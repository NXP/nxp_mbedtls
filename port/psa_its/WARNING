When using this module, do remember that the PSA persistent key
meta data used by PSA Slot management implementation is being stored
in plain format here. So this should be used at your own discretion.

For ELE4xx module, the key ID and attributes are also maintained by
the ELE implementation. So there is not much RISK if someone manipulates
this metadata. Else TFM with its ITS implementation or more robust
storage implementation should be used.
