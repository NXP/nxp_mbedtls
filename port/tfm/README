These are helper files to get mbedtls3x to properly link against the TF-M NS PSA API.
The next major version of mbedtls is set to be decoupled from PSA completely, which will make this obsolete.

entropy_poll_alt.c:
Provides an alternative implementation for mbedtls' entropy polling that calls psa_generate_random(2) on the TF-M interface.

psa_can_do_apis.c
Provides psa_can_do_hash definition on TF-M NS end. File can be extended if definition is required for psa_can_do_cipher.
As per release notes of Mbedtls 3.6.3:
MD module can now perform PSA dispatching also when
MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT && !MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C, even though this
configuration is not officially supported. This requires that a
PSA Crypto provider library which:
 - supports the required PSA_WANT_ALG_xxx and
 - implements psa_can_do_hash() on the client interface
   is linked against Mbed TLS and that psa_crypto_init() is called before
   performing any PSA call.
